# Space Support Test

## Input Fields that Support Spaces

All input fields in the certificate generator now properly support spaces and special characters:

### Student Information
- ✅ **Student Name**: Supports full names with spaces (e.g., "John Doe Smith")
- ✅ **Student Email**: Supports email addresses with standard format

### Course Information
- ✅ **Course Title**: Supports course titles with spaces (e.g., "Advanced React Development")
- ✅ **Instructor Name**: Supports instructor names with spaces (e.g., "Dr. Sarah Johnson")
- ✅ **Course Duration**: Supports text with spaces (e.g., "12 weeks", "40 hours")

### Signature Information
- ✅ **Signature Name**: Supports names with spaces (e.g., "Michael Smith")
- ✅ **Signature Title**: Supports titles with spaces (e.g., "Chief Academic Officer")

## Security Features
- All inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- Special HTML characters are properly escaped
- Input length is limited to prevent buffer overflow attacks

## Fixed Issues

1. **Fabric.js Import Error**: ✅ Fixed
   - Changed from `import { fabric } from 'fabric'` to `import { Canvas, Rect, Text, Line, Circle } from 'fabric'`
   - Updated all fabric.js API calls to use the new v6 syntax

2. **TypeScript Type Errors**: ✅ Fixed
   - Removed all `any` types
   - Added proper type definitions for field updates
   - Fixed function parameter types

3. **Unused Imports**: ✅ Fixed
   - Removed unused imports like `generateQRCodeData`
   - Removed unused variables like `fabricCanvas` and `setFabricCanvas`

4. **React Hook Dependencies**: ✅ Fixed
   - Added missing dependencies to useEffect hooks
   - Properly ordered hook declarations

## Test Cases for Spaces

Try entering these values in the form to verify space support:

- Student Name: "John Doe Smith Jr."
- Course Title: "Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp"
- Instructor: "Dr. Maria Elena Rodriguez"
- Duration: "16 weeks intensive training"
- Signature Name: "Prof. Alexander Thompson"
- Signature Title: "Director of Academic Affairs"

All these should work perfectly and display correctly on the certificate preview.
